# Badcalc 2.0
After seemingly stopping coding for a while I have began anew, and with that I have reread the section of thebook I am reading. I have also decided to entirely rewrite this program from the ground up during an 
uneventful day at school
## Differences:
what I did was instead of using an obnoxiously large amount of if statements was use a switch statement
In addtion to that swtich statement was that I made seperate functions each for adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, square roots, and lastly exponents. 
funnily enought this code has no if statements what so ever, but that is very likely to change very soon.
## What has been lost
Besides cutting the amount of lines to about a 5th of what the original program was, there were a lot of things I decided to just not add like probabiliy, I plan to add back trigonomotric funtions but due to the fact that I wrote this all in one day in between classes has it has been dictated that I could not yet.
